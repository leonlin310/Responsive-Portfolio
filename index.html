            <p>My name is Leon Lin, and welcome to my page! This website will detail my journey as I jump into a new
                career as a Full Stack Web Developer. The goal is to create this and to see real progress as I progress
                through
                this intensive 6 month bootcamp. This webpage will also be a starting point for my portfolio of works.
            </p>


            <p>I grew up in the Chicagoland area and have been living in the city of Chicago for over 10 years. My
                favorite sports are Ping Pong, Basketball, Skiing, and Running. I used to do these all the time, but now
                I do
                them occasionally. On the weekdays, I can be spotted roaming the River North area. On the weekends, I
                split
                the majority of my time traveling between Chicago and Rockford, where I spoil my nephews and niece. Feel
                free to click around and write a Comment in the "Comments" section! (Hint: There's no Comment Section
                Yet)</p>
            </p>

            <p>
                I currently work in the Financial sector, specifically in the private wealth management field. My job is
                to build portfolio's based on the financial profile of each client. We can build aggressive, income
                generating, speculative, and defensive portfolios which are dependent on risk factors and age. These
                portfolios will be diversified by investing in multiple asset classes assets such as SMA's, Mutual
                Funds, ETF's, Primary and Secondary Offerings, Structured Products, and Alternative Investments. I'm
                doing this bootcamp to expand my skillset, and to possibly jump into a new career or have this as a
                freelance job.
